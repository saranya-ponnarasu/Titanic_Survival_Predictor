# Titanic_Survival_Predictor


### Problem Statement:
Predict survival on the Titanic using logistic regression by exploring relationships between passenger characteristics and survival outcomes through data cleaning, EDA, and model training. Dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

### Objective:
To predict Titanic survival with a logistic regression model, aiming for higher accuracy, precision, and recall using dataset features.

### Libraries Used:
1. Numpy (for data manipulation)
2. Pandas (for data manipulation)
3. Matplotlib (for data visualization)
3. Seaborn (for data visualization)
4. Statstools (for data modeling)
5. Scikit-Learn (for data modeling)
6. Collections (for counting occurences)
7. imblearn (for oversampling)
